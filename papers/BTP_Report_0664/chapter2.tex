\section{Queueing Games}

We consider a game on a network of nodes with players $\mathcal{N} = \{1,2,\ldots,N\}$ and nodes $\mathcal{C} = \{1,2,\ldots,C\}$. Every node $i \in \mathcal{C}$ is a FIFO queue with an exponential service rate $\mu_i$. Each player $j \in \mathcal{N}$ has its customers arriving with a Poisson process with rate $\lambda^{(j)}$. Every player $j \in \mathcal{N}$ is given a set of routes $R^{(j)}$, and must assign each of its customer to a route $r\in R^{(j)}$. The strategy of player $j\in \mathcal{N}$ is given by vector $p^{(j)}$, where $p^{(j)}_r$ denotes the probability that the player assigns its customers to route $r \in R^{(j)}$.

We consider each node $i \in \mathcal{C}$ to be a multi-type $M/M/1$ queue with customer types $\mathcal{T} = \{1, 2, \ldots , T\}$. For node $i\in \mathcal{C}$, the service time is exponential with rate $\mu_i$ and the arrival rate of customer of type $t\in\mathcal{T}$ is $\lambda_i(t)$.

The node $i\in \mathcal{C}$ is stable if and only if $\rho_i := \sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}}\rho_i(t) < 1$ where $\rho_i(t) = \lambda_i(t)/\mu_i$ for $t\in\mathcal{T}$.

\begin{example}
An example of a queueing game is given in Figure \ref{fig:2P3N_example}.
Here
$\mathcal{N} = \{1,2\}$, $\mathcal{R}^{(1)} = \{(1,4),(2),(2,3,4)\}$ and
$\mathcal{R}^{(2)} = \{(3),(1)\}$
\end{example}



\section{Congestion Games}
\begin{definition} A Congestion Game is defined by tuple
\[
\Gamma = \left(\mathcal{N},\,\mathcal{R},\,(\Sigma_i)_{i\in\mathcal{N}},\, (d_r)_{r\in\mathcal{R}} \right)\] where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{N} = \{1,...,n\}$ is the set of players
    \item $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of resources
    \item $\Sigma_j \subset 2^{\mathcal{R}}$ is the strategy space of player $j$
    \item $d_r : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}$ is the delay function for resource $r$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\noindent
The cost of player $j$ in state $S \in \Sigma_1\times...\times\Sigma_n$,
is $ c_j(S) = \sum_{r\in S_j}d_r(n_r(S))$ where $n_r = |\{j\in\mathcal{N}:r\in S_j\}|$.

\begin{definition}
A Weighted Congestion Game is defined by a tuple $\Gamma = \left(\mathcal{N},\,\mathcal{R},\,(\Sigma_i)_{i\in\mathcal{N}},\, (d_r)_{r\in\mathcal{R}},\, (w_i)_{i\in\mathcal{N}} \right)$. Here
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{N},\mathcal{R},\Sigma_i$ have same definition as congestion game
    \item $d_r:\mathbb{R}^+\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^+$ is a non-decreasing function giving the delay for using resource $r$
    \item $w_i$ is the weight of player $i$
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The cost of player $j$ in state $S \in \Sigma_1\times...\times\Sigma_n$,
is $ c_j(S) = \sum_{r\in S_j}d_r(w_r)$ where $w_r := \sum_{\{i\in\mathcal{N} : r \in S_i\}} w_i$ is the sum of weights of players using resource $r$.
\end{definition}


The following theorem shows that a Nash equilibrium exists for any congestion game and also shows that the algorithm in Chapter 3 converges to a Nash Equilibrium.

\begin{definition}
A step $S$ to $S'=(S_i'~,~S_{-i})$ is called an improvement step if $c_i(S)>c_i(S')$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Rosenthal 1973]
For congestion games, every sequence of improvement steps is finite.
\end{theorem}

For proving this, we need to look at the Rosenthal's potential function, which for every state $S$ is defined to be
$$\Phi(S) = \sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}}\sum_{k=1}^{n_r(S)}d_r(k)$$

\begin{lemma}
Let $S$ be any state and $S_i$ be an alternative strategy for player $i$.
Then
$$\Phi(S_i',S_{-i}) - \Phi(S) = c_i(S_i',S_{-i})-c_i(S)$$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
From definition of Rosenthal's Potential function

\begin{align}
\Phi(S_i',S_{-i}) - \Phi(S) &= \sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}}\sum_{k=1}^{n_r(S_i',S_{-i})}d_r(k) -\sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}}\sum_{k=1}^{n_r(S)}d_r(k) \nonumber \\
  &= \sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}} \left( \sum_{k=1}^{n_r(S_i',S_{-i})}d_r(k) - \sum_{k=1}^{n_r(S)} d_r(k) \right) \nonumber \\
  &= \sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}} \Delta_r \label{eqn:rosen_pot}
\end{align}

 where $\Delta_r := \sum_{k=1}^{n_r(S_i',S_{-i})}d_r(k) - \sum_{k=1}^{n_r(S)} d_r(k)$.
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Case 1: $r\in S_i$ and $r \in S_i'$ then $\Delta_r = 0$
     \item Case 2: $r\notin S_i$ and $r \notin S_i'$ then $\Delta_r = 0$
     \item Case 3: $r\notin S_i$ and $r \in S_i'$ then
     $n_r(S_i',S_{-i})=n_r(S)+1$ so $\Delta_r=d_r(n_r(S_i',S_{-i}))$
     \item Case 4: $r\in S_i$ and $r\notin S_i'$ then 
     $n_r(S_i',S_{-i})=n_r(S)-1$ so $\Delta_r=-d_r(n_r(S))$
 \end{itemize}

And we've
\begin{align}
    c_i(S_i',S_i)-c_i(S) &= \sum_{r\in S_i'}d_r(n_r(S_i',S_{-i})) - \sum_{r\in S_i}d_r(n_r(S)) \nonumber \\
    &= \sum_{r\in S_i' \; r\notin S_i} d_r(n_r(S_i',S_{-i})) - \sum_{r\notin S_i' \; r\in S_i}d_r(n_r(S)) \nonumber \\
    &= \sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}} \Delta_r \label{eqn:rosen_cost}
\end{align}

From \ref{eqn:rosen_cost} and \ref{eqn:rosen_pot}, we got the desired result.

\end{proof}


\begin{proof}
We prove Rosenthal's Theorem by contradiction. Assume that there exists
an infinite sequence of improvement steps $S^{(1)}, S^{(2)},\ldots $.
By the previous Lemma and definition of improvement step
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:imp_step}
\Phi(S^{(i)}) > \Phi(S^{(j)}) \quad \forall \; i,j\in\mathbb{N}, \; i < j
\end{equation}
As there are finitely many states, there must exist $i<j$ such that
$S^{(i)}=S^{(j)}$. Hence $\Phi(S^{(i)})=\Phi(S^{(j)})$ which contradicts
the \ref{eqn:imp_step}.
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
There exists a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for $N$-player games on a network of single server queues when all customers have equal arrival rates i.e. $\lambda^{j}=\lambda$ for all $j\in\mathcal{N}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We prove this by showing that this is equivalent to a congestion game.
Since congestion games have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, then so does this sub-class of queueing game.
\end{proof}

\section{N-player game in discrete strategy space}

For players with equal arrival rates, we can define a delay function at each node $i$.

$$d_i(x) = \frac{1}{\mu - x\lambda}$$

So the payoff/mean sojourn time for player $j$ in discrete-strategy profile $p$ is given by 

$$f^{(j)}(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{C}\frac{\mathbb{1}_{i\in r_j(p)}}{\mu_i - x_i(p)\lambda}
 = \sum_{i\in r_i(p)} d_i(x_i(p))$$

 
where $x_i(p) = \sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}} \mathbb{1}_{i\in r_j(p)}$ and $r^{(j)}(p)$ is the route chosen by player $j$ in discrete-strategy $p$.

Clearly, $d_i(x)$ is a monotone increasing function in $x$. So this is a congestion game.
